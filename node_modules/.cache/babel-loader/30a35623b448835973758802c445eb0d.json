My friends that I met through badminton convinced me to try volleyball and join their league at UVic. This league ran for 4 months, and was based on a ladder format, where points would be scored for every win, allowing your team to climbing up the ladder and play against higher skilled teams. Each team was a team of 6, and I only knew 2 of my teammates. I am thankful to have met such wonderful people playing in this league.\r\n                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                I barely knew how volleyball worked initially, or even how to bump or set a volleyball. From continuous practice and playing, learning from my teammates, and doing some research, I have gotten significantly better since the beginning. I pretty much play volleyball just as often as I play badminton now, playing at drop-ins with my friends, and in leagues on teams. I never thought I would be so interested in volleyball, but I guess you will never know until you try.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"hobbies-interests-col\">\r\n              <div className=\"hobbies-interests-2-2\"></div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"hobbies-interests-row-breaker\"></div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"hobbies-interests-row\">\r\n            <div className=\"hobbies-interests-col\">\r\n              <h2 ref={this.state.refSkiing} className=\"hobbies-interests-heading-3\">Skiing</h2>\r\n              <p className=\"hobbies-interests-3-1\">\r\n                Since I was a kid, I continuously went skiing every season at least once. In my mind, it is one of those sports where you should really enjoy while you can as you can only go so often on the west coast. My parents initially taught me the basics in skiing, however from there, it was on my own, purely learning through trial and error, and from my sisters and friends. \r\n                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                I have tried snowboarding a couple times, however I found that I enjoyed skiing significantly more, mostly because I feel more agile and enjoy being able to move both my legs freely. Maybe in the future I will give snowboarding another try, however at this time, I will be continuing to ski.\r\n                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                Overall, the planning, preparing, traveling to the slopes, having fun, and then traveling back only to shower, clean up, and eat a large meal all makes up for a wonderful time and activity with your friends and family. \r\n
