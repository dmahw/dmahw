badminton when I was in elementary school and continued playing until grade 8, the year 2009. It was the longest sport that I was interested in, however I never played it seriously and quickly lost interest in it in middle school. Since, I rarely played any sports outside of school, instead I joined other extra curricular activities such as Stagecraft and Leadership.\r\n                <br /><br />\r\n                Starting in the summer of 2018 when I moved to Vancouver for a co-op position, I started playing badminton again, and made many new friends from it. I pretty much started as a beginner, however from playing at least twice a week to nearly every single day, I have learned a lot and now able to play extremely well against intermediate players. While my skill level is far from participating in tournaments, I am extremely grateful for playing badminton again as it got me interested in playing sports again, and I have made many new connections from it.\r\n                <br /><br />\r\n                To this day, I still play badminton frequently, slowly getting better at it, and meeting new people. It is a community that I am glad to be part of and hope to entice more of my friends to join. It is a great team bonding experience, allowing to you to really get to know someone based on their attitude and teamwork skills.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"hobbies-interests-col\">\r\n              <div className=\"hobbies-interests-1-2\"></div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"hobbies-interests-row-breaker\"></div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"hobbies-interests-row\">\r\n            <div className=\"hobbies-interests-col\">\r\n              <h2 ref={this.state.ref.volleyball} className=\"hobbies-interests-heading-2\">Volleyball</h2>\r\n              <p className=\"hobbies-interests-2-1\">\r\n                In January of 2019, I started playing volleyball. My friends that I met through badminton convinced me to try volleyball and join their league at UVic. This league ran for 4 months, and was based on a ladder format, where points would be scored for every win, allowing your team to climbing up the ladder and play against higher skilled teams. Each team was a team of 6, and I only knew 2 of my teammates. I am thankful to have met such wonderful people playing in this league.\r\n                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                I barely knew how volleyball worked initially, or even how to bump or set a volleyball. From continuous practice and playing, learning from my teammates, and doing some research, I have gotten significantly better since the beginning. I pretty much play volleyball just as often as I play badminton now, playing at drop-ins with my friends, and in leagues on teams. I never thought I would be so interested in volleyball, but I guess you will never know until you try.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"hobbies-interests-col\">\r\n              <div className=\"hobbies-interests-2-2\"></div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"hobbies-interests-row-breaker\"></div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"hobbies-interests-row\">\r\n            <div className=\"hobbies-interests-col\">\r\n              <h2 ref={this.state.ref.skiing} className=\"hobbies-interests-heading-3\">Skiing</h2>\r\n              <p className=\"hobbies-interests-3-1\">\r\n                Since I was a kid, I continuously went skiing every season at least once. In my mind, it is one of those sports where you should really enjoy while you can as you can only go so often on the west coast. My parents initially taught me the basics in skiing, however from there, it was on my own, purely learning through trial and error, and from my sisters and friends. \r\n                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                I have tried snowboarding a couple times, however I found that I enjoyed skiing significantly more, mostly because I feel more agile and enjoy being able to move both my legs freely. Maybe in the future I will give snowboarding another try, however at this time, I will be continuing to ski.\r\n                <br></br><br></br>\r\n                Overall, the planning, preparing, traveling to the slopes, having fun, and then traveling back only to shower, clean up, and eat a large meal all makes up for a wonderful time and activity with your friends and family. \r\n
